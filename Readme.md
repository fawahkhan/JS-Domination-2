## JavaScript Projects — Learning Exercises & Mini-builds

A collection of vanilla JavaScript mini-projects built to practice and master core concepts. Each one lives in its own folder and runs by simply opening `index.html`.

### Projects
- **Project 1 · Basic Keydown Playground** — Mirrors any pressed key into a giant heading; handles the space bar gracefully.
- **Project 2 · File Upload Button** — Hides the native file input behind a custom button and swaps its label with the chosen file name.
- **Project 3 · Profile Card Generator** — Captures form input and instantly renders styled profile cards without page reloads.
- **Project 4 · Interactive Cursor Tracker** — A red square follows your mouse around the screen; turns yellow on hover using mouse events and smooth CSS transitions.
- **Project 5 · Live Character Counter** — A Twitter-style character counter that displays remaining characters and turns red when exceeding the 20-character limit.
- **Project 6 · Delegated Event Handler Todo List** — A fruit list where items toggle strikethrough on click, demonstrating event delegation and event bubbling.

### Run locally
1) Clone/download this repo. 2) Open any project folder. 3) Double-click `index.html` (no builds or deps).

Note: These were built to get my hands dirty with JS; HTML/CSS is intentionally minimal. I’ll polish the visuals once the core JS essentials are solid.

### What you’ll practice
- Hooking `click`, `change`, and `keydown` listeners on DOM nodes and `window`.
- Preventing default form submits to keep the page alive.
- Creating and styling elements on the fly with vanilla JS.

### What’s next
- More event-driven mini-builds as I learn new things.
