## Event Listener Lab — three micro-projects that react in real time

Build muscle memory for vanilla JS events with three tiny demos: a keydown playground, a custom upload button, and a profile card generator. Each one lives in its own folder and runs by simply opening `index.html`.

### Projects
- **Project 1 · Basic Keydown Playground** — Mirrors any pressed key into a giant heading; handles the space bar gracefully.
- **Project 2 · File Upload Button** — Hides the native file input behind a custom button and swaps its label with the chosen file name.
- **Project 3 · Profile Card Generator** — Captures form input and instantly renders styled profile cards without page reloads.

### Run locally
1) Clone/download this repo. 2) Open any project folder. 3) Double-click `index.html` (no builds or deps).

### Live previews

- Project 2: https://fawahkhan.github.io/Project-2-DOM-and-EventListeners/
- Project 3: https://fawahkhan.github.io/Project-3-Profile-Card-Generator/

Note: These were built to get my hands dirty with JS; HTML/CSS is intentionally minimal. I’ll polish the visuals once the core JS essentials are solid.

### What you’ll practice
- Hooking `click`, `change`, and `keydown` listeners on DOM nodes and `window`.
- Preventing default form submits to keep the page alive.
- Creating and styling elements on the fly with vanilla JS.

### What’s next
- More event-driven mini-builds as I learn new things.
