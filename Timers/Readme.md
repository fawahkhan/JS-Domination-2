### Timers and Intervals are of 4 major types :

- setTimeout: run something once after a delay; good for a single deferred action.
- setInterval: run something repeatedly on a fixed delay; good when it needs to keep happening.
- clearTimeout: stop a scheduled timeout before it runs.
- clearInterval: stop a running interval so it does not keep firing.

- setTimeout and setInteval take a function & delay time in milliseconds as parameters
